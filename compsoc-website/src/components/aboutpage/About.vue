    <b-card title="Code" class="mb-3">
      Knowledge is power and here at the RHUL Computing Society we strive to help you learn all you can about computers and programming. We hosts a plethora of workshops and lectures about different programming languages (Java, Python, etc.), software(Linux, Git etc.) and other computer science related topics hosted by us and by a number of industry veterans. Through us you can also volunteer to teach programming to kids at schools(write this bit better). On top of all that we'll be running several hackathons this year and other coding events, so keep your eyes peeled.

      After a long day and arduous day of lectures, labs and group projects wouldn't you like to have some fun with your chums. Through out the year you can expect us to be hosting a lot of social events - trips, xSocials, pubcrawls, you name it. No seriously, we accept suggestions. We like to party hard and to chill out.
